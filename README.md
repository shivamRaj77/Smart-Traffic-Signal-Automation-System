# Smart-Traffic-Signal-Automation-System
# 🔐🚦 Smart Traffic Congestion Control System

A privacy-aware smart traffic signal control system that uses Machine Learning to predict congestion at road junctions and dynamically allocate green signal timings.  
The system is designed to later integrate cryptographic techniques so that traffic data can be processed securely without exposing raw vehicle information.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas. Traditional traffic systems:
- Use fixed-time signals  
- Do not adapt to real-time traffic  
- Often collect raw vehicle data, leading to privacy issues  

This project:
- Predicts congestion using ML
- Dynamically controls signal timings
- Can be extended to operate on encrypted data
- Avoids centralized surveillance of vehicle movement

## 🧠 Core Idea

Each junction is modeled as a 4-way intersection:

```
       North
         ↑
West ←---+---→ East
         ↓
       South
```

For every junction:
- Vehicle count and average speed are collected per direction
- Congestion is calculated
- Green signal time is allocated proportionally

The city is modeled as a 3×3 grid:
```
 J1 -------- J2 -------- J3
  |           |           |
 J4 -------- J5 -------- J6
  |           |           |
 J7 -------- J8 -------- J9
```
Each junction works independently using the same ML model.

## 📥 Input Format

For each junction:

[N_count, N_speed,
S_count, S_speed,
E_count, E_speed,
W_count, W_speed]


Where:
- `count` = number of vehicles  
- `speed` = average speed in km/h

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyTorch  

---

## 🗄️ Backend Database (PostgreSQL)

The FastAPI backend in [smart_traffic](smart_traffic) uses SQLAlchemy and can connect
to PostgreSQL via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Example (see [smart_traffic/.env.example](smart_traffic/.env.example)):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/smart_traffic
```

Notes:
- Set `DATABASE_URL` before running the backend.
- The backend will create tables automatically on startup.
